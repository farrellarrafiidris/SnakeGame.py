1. The game window will appear with two snakes, one green (Snake 1) and one blue (Snake 2).

2. Each snake starts with a length of 3 body parts.

3. Food appears as a red circle or other color.

4. Player 1 controls their snake using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).

5. Player 2 controls their snake using the letters w, s, a, d.

6. The snakes grow longer by eating food. Food spawns randomly on the screen.

7. Avoid collisions with the walls, your own snake's body, or the other snake's body.

8. The game ends when either snake collides with a wall or itself.

9. The snake with the longest body at the end wins!

## Tips:üóíÔ∏è

- Try to strategically cut off the other snake's path to force them to collide.

- Pay close attention to your snake's direction and avoid sudden changes that might result in a collision.

- The game can be challenging at first, so practice and strategize your movements!
